# Package Management

## 1) **C++**
C++ doesn't have a universal version manager like Go's `gvm` or Python's `pyenv` because compilers (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) are platform-specific and behave differently. However, you can manage different versions of C++ compilers manually using:

- **Homebrew (macOS/Linux)**: You can install multiple versions of GCC or Clang and switch between them.
  ```bash
  brew install gcc@9
  brew install gcc@10
  ```

  To use a specific version:
  ```bash
  export CC=gcc-9
  export CXX=g++-9
  ```

### **`Conan` (Cross-Platform Package Manager)**

`Conan` is another popular package manager for C++ that is cross-platform and highly configurable.

1. **Install `Conan`**:
   ```bash
   pip install conan   # via Python's pip
   ```

2. **Create a Conan configuration** (`conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py`):
   ```txt
   [requires]
   fmt/8.0.1  # Specify the library and version

   [generators]
   cmake
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   From the root of your project, run:
   ```bash
   conan install . --build=missing
   ```

4. **Integrate with CMake**:
   Use the generated `conanbuildinfo.cmake` file in your CMake project:
   ```cmake
   include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
   conan_basic_setup()
   ```

5. **Build and link your project**:
   After `conan install`, you can proceed with the usual CMake build process:
   ```bash
   cmake .
   cmake --build .
   ```

### Comparison of C++ Package Managers

| **Feature**       | **vcpkg**                      | **Conan**                      | **Hunter**                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Platform**      | Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS) | Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS) | Cross-platform (Linux/macOS)    |
| **CMake Integration** | Easy, built-in              | Requires some setup            | Directly integrates with CMake  |
| **Community Support** | Strong, maintained by Microsoft | Large community, many packages | Smaller, CMake-focused         |
| **Package Availability** | Large library of popular packages | Very large repository of packages | Moderate repository size       |

For most C++ projects, **Conan** or **vcpkg** would be the recommended choice for managing dependencies efficiently.

## GoLang -> GVM

`gvm` is a tool that allows you to easily install, manage, and switch between different versions of Go on your system. Itâ€™s especially useful if you need to work with multiple Go versions across different projects, similar to how **`conda`** manages Python environments.

Key Features:

- Install specific versions of Go.
- Switch between installed versions.
- Set a default Go version.
- Create and manage Go environments for different projects.

### Installing and using `gvm`

1. **Install prerequisites** (on Ubuntu, for example):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install curl git mercurial make binutils bison gcc
   ```
2. **Install `gvm`**:
   ```bash
   bash < <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
   ```
3. **Source `gvm`** (to make it available in your shell):
   ```bash
   source ~/.gvm/scripts/gvm
   ```
4. **Install a Go version**:
   ```bash
   gvm install go1.20
   ```
5. **List installed versions**:
   ```bash
   gvm list
   ```
6. **Switch to a specific version**:
   ```bash
   gvm use go1.20
   ```
7. **Set a default version**:
   ```bash
   gvm use go1.20 --default
   ```
8. **Check current Go version**:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```
9. **Uninstall a Go version**:
   ```bash
   gvm uninstall go1.20
   ```
